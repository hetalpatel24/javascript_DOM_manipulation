# Save_Earth

## Javascript and DOM manipulation

The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and **www.ALIENS-R-REAL.com** has collected all of the eye-witness reports to prove it! As a 
web develper, all I need to do is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.


The collection is too large to search through manually. Hence, I developed a javascript code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset](/new_data.js). We also need to allow our users to search through the table for specific pieces of information. There's a catch though... We only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted !!

### Automatic Table and Multiple Search Categories

* Create a basic HTML web page that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
* Columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least are created.
* Used multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns on the HTML document.
* JavaScript code that will help the user to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on table columns:
  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
